## DEPLOYMENT ⚙️

The project has been successfully deployed using Netlify. You can access the production version of the website by following this link: [https://homie-furniture.netlify.app](https://djoeskode.site) or [this link](https://www.djoeskode.site).

### Deployment status :

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/0291a9f3-ec77-4ea4-b36c-f9481db8029f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/homie-furniture/deploys)

1. Connect your account to Netlify !

The first step to deploy in Netlify is creating a new account or use existing account. As a beginner progammer, I would prefer using GitHub account instead.

After you successfully login, you will be redirected to dashboard of Netlify app. In this scenario, you will need to import your existing project from github to netlify. Add new site -> Import existing project -> Connect via GitHub

2. Auto Deploy with Netlify !

One of the benefit using your GitHub account connected to Netlify is that you don't have to worry about re-deploying your project manually, once there are changes that have been pushed in your repository, it will automatically re-deployed by Netlify within second.

3. Domain Registrar with NiagaHoster & Cloudfire !

Go to [https://niagahoster.co.id](https://niagahoster.co.id) and log in or create a new account. Check available domain that you wanted and make it yours.

4. Modify your project with favorite customize domain !

You're on the final step to bringing live your project with custom domain. Go to Netlify Dashboard -> Domain -> Add domain that you have set previously -> Look for Name Servers. You will see the information of Nameserver that is given to you.

```
Type  Value
NS    dns1.p01.nsone.net
NS    dns2.p01.nsone.net
NS    dns3.p01.nsone.net
NS    dns4.p01.nsone.net
```

Copy these nameserver and jump into dashboard overview of NiagaHoster. You should replace it with NameServer of Netlify.

Final step, go to dashboard Niagahoster -> Domain -> Domain Portfolio -> Choose a domain name and manage -> DNS/Nameserver -> Change nameserver.

5. Congratulations, You're done !

You should wait within 1x24 hours to let the NiagaHoster and Netlify setting up the DNS, it could be faster or slower depending on the provider internet that you're using.
